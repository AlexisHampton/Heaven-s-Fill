# Heaven-s-Fill
A game I made for Narrative Driven Jam 11
You play as an investigator, named Anita, who has to find the thief who stole the High Elf's staff. Talk to past lovers, current friends, and strangers who had once been much closer. 

And arrest someone, be it friend or foe, to the dismay or praise of the High Elf. 

Play time is about 15 minutes .
